## Introduction

Hello! 

This repository is filled with code implementations of fundamental and some advance data structures, search algorithms, and graph traversal algorithms. This codebase was written in C# (you're welcome Microsofters and Unity developers). However, I made sure to make variables and functions as clear as possible so that it can be easily read and understood in every other programming language.

Feel free to look over my C# references and don't be shy if you find something wrong, found better ways to do things, or want to contribute to the bettering of this repository. Anything helps and is welcomed!


## Inspiration


This repository was originally written in my notebook while I was studying for coding interviews and bettering my software engineering skills. I had decided to post my notes and implementations online so I have a digital copy of all the notes and implementation I took the time and hard work to figure out. I also decided to create this repository because I did have some difficulties finding resources for implementing data structures and algorithms in C#, especially for the more advance concepts. Generally, I found a lot of Java, C++, and Python resources but I thought it would be great for C# enthusiasts to have fundamentals they'd need to know all in one place.


## Organization


This reference is divided into three folders: data structure, search algorithm, and graph theory. Within those folders, there are sub folders for each individual concept. This is so we can add implementations in other languages, extra files for testing or general notes.

Note that each main.cs file contains the actual classes for the various data structures and algorithms but they do not contain Main functions. You may clone or test these files on your own, although in the future I may add my own tests in this repository.
